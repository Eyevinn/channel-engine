The Eyevinn Channel Engine is an NPM library that provides the functionality to generate "fake" live HLS stream by stitching HLS VOD's together. The library is provided as open source and this repository includes a basic reference implementation as a guide on how the library can be used.

## Usage

To use this library in your NodeJS project download and install the library in your project by running the following in your project folder.

```
$ npm install --save eyevinn-channel-engine
```

To run the basic reference implementation included in this repository you run:

```
$ npm start
```

And to run the basic reference implementation for using demuxed VODs you run:

```
$ npm run start-demux
```


Then point your HLS video player to `http://localhost:8000/live/master.m3u8?channel=1` to start playing the linear live stream.

## Master manifest filtering

The engine supports a very simplistic and basic filtering of media playlists included in the master manifest. Currently supports to filter on video bandwidth and video height. To specify a filter provide the query parameter `filter` when loading the master manifest, e.g. `(type=="video"&&height>200)&&(type=="video"&&height<400)`. This needs to be URL encoded resulting in the following URL: `http://localhost:8000/live/master.m3u8?channel=1&filter=%28type%3D%3D%22video%22%26%26height%3E200%29%26%26%28type%3D%3D%22video%22%26%26height%3C400%29`

## API

Initiate and start the engine as below.

```
const ChannelEngine = require('eyevinn-channel-engine');

const engine = new ChannelEngine(myAssetManager, { channelManager: myChannelManager });
engine.start();
engine.listen(process.env.port || 8000);
```

where `myAssetManager` and `myChannelManager` are classes implementing the interfaces below.

```
class MyAssetManager {
  getNextVod({ sessionId, category, playlistId }) -> { id, title, uri, offset, timedMetadata? }
  handleError(err, vodResponse)
}

class MyChannelManager {
  getChannels() -> [ { id, name, slate?, closedCaptions?, profile?, audioTracks?, options? } ]
}
```

Find a simplistic reference implementation for guidance in `./server.js`.


### Enabling Demuxed Audio
**LIMITATIONS:** At the moment, only supported for assets with matching audio track GROUP-IDs. Assets with different GROUP-IDs on their tracks will not be loaded correctly when transitioning between them, resulting in buffer errors. (This will be fixed).

To support playing assets with multiple audio tracks, a list of supported languages needs to be pre-defined. 
Assign to the `audioTracks` property,
in the return object for the channel manager class's `getChannels()` function, a list of objects in the following format

```
{
  language: { type: string } ,
  name:  { type: string },
  default: { type: bool } // optional
}
```
Example value for `audioTracks`:
``` 
audioTracks = [ { language: "en", name: "English", default: true }, { language: "es", name: "EspaÃ±ol" } ];
```
**NOTE:** In the case where an asset does not have a track in a language found in the pre-defined list, then the asset's default track will be played in its place.

### Options

Available options when constructing the Channel Engine object are:

- `defaultSlateUri`: URI to an HLS VOD that can be inserted when a VOD for some reason cannot be loaded.
- `slateRepetitions`: Number of times the slate should be repeated.
- `redisUrl`: A Redis DB URL for storing states that can be shared between nodes.
- `memcachedUrl`: A Memcached URL for storing states that can be shared between nodes.
- `sharedStoreCacheTTL`: How long should data be cached in memory before writing to shared store. Default is 1000 ms.
- `heartbeat`: Path for heartbeat requests
- `channelManager`: A reference to a channel manager object.
- `streamSwitchManager`: A reference to a stream switch manager object.
- `cacheTTL`: Sets the cache-control header TTL. Default is 4 sec.
- `playheadDiffThreshold`: Sets the threshold when starting to adjust tick interval to compensate for playhead drift.
- `maxTickInterval`: The maximum interval for playhead tick interval. Default is 10000 ms.
- `cloudWatchMetrics`: Output CloudWatch JSON metrics on console log. Default is false.
- `useDemuxedAudio`: Enable playing VODs with multiple audio tracks. Default is false.

## High Availability (BETA)

As the engine is not a stateless microservice accomplish high availablity and redundancy is not a trivial task, and requires a shared cache cluster (also redundant) to store current state.

![High-level drawing of High Availability](docs/channel_engine_ha_high_level.png)

A beta-version of high availability support is available in the Channel Engine and it uses Redis as the shared storage. This allows you to run a replicaset behind a round-robin load balancer as examplified in the drawing above. To enable high-availability initiate the engine with the URL to the Redis cache.

```
const engineOptions = {
  heartbeat: '/',
  averageSegmentDuration: 2000,
  channelManager: refChannelManager,
  defaultSlateUri: "https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/slate-consuo.mp4/master.m3u8",
  slateRepetitions: 10,
  redisUrl: "redis://127.0.0.1",
};

const engine = new ChannelEngine(refAssetManager, engineOptions);
engine.start();
engine.listen(process.env.port || 8000);
```

Note that this feature is currently in beta which means that it is close to production-ready but has not been run in production yet. We appreciate all efforts to try this out and provide feedback.


## Live Mixing (BETA)

This feature gives the possibility to mix in a true live stream in a Channel Engine powered linear channel (VOD2Live).

![RFC Drawing of Live-Mixing Functionality](rfc/channel_engine_vod_with_live.png)

A beta-version of live-mixing with high availability support is available in the Channel Engine. This allows you to use a new component which can let you break in to a scheduled VOD event or Live stream event at any speficied time on top of the usual vod-to-live content. 
To enable live-mixing, create a class which implements the following interface.

```
class MyStreamSwitchManager {
  getSchedule() -> [ { eventId, assetId, title, type, start_time, end_time, uri, duration } ]
}
```

The class's `getSchedule()` function should return a list of event objects in the following format:

```
{
  "eventId": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Generated ID of the event. If not specified a uuid-based eventId will be generated"
  },
  "assetId": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "The ID of the asset in the schedule event"
  },
  "title": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Title of the asset"
  },
  "type": {
    "type": "number",
    "description": "Type of event (1=LIVE and 2=VOD)"
  },
  "start_time": {
    "type": "number",
    "description": "UTC Start time of the event as a Unix Timestamp (in milliseconds)"
  },
  "end_time": {
    "type": "number",
    "description": "UTC End time of the event as a Unix Timestamp (in milliseconds)"
  },
  "uri": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "The URI to the VOD asset or Live Stream"
  },
  "duration": {
    "type": "number",
    "description": "The duration of the asset (in milliseconds) NOTE: Not required for Live Stream events"
  }
}
```

Below are examples of a Live stream event and a VOD event respectively:
```
{
  eventId: "eeecd5ce-d2d2-48db-b1b3-233957f7d69e",
  assetId: "live-asset-4",
  title: "My scheduled Live stream event",
  type: 1,
  start_time: 1631003900000,
  end_time: 1631003921000,
  uri: "https://cph-p2p-msl.akamaized.net/hls/live/2000341/test/master.m3u8",
}
```
```
{
  eventId: "26453eea-0ac2-4b89-a87a-73d369920874",
  assetId: "vod-asset-13",
  title: "My scheduled VOD event",
  type: 2,
  start_time: 1631004100000,
  end_time: 1631004121000,
  uri: "https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/VINN.mp4/master.m3u8",
  duration: 2 * 60 * 1000,
}
```
Then create an instance of the class and reference it as the `streamSwitchManager` in your engineOptions, just like you'd do with the channel manager. 

```
const MyStreamSwitchManager = new MyStreamSwitchManager();

const engineOptions = {
  heartbeat: '/',
  averageSegmentDuration: 2000,
  channelManager: MyChannelManager,
  defaultSlateUri: "https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/slate-consuo.mp4/master.m3u8",
  slateRepetitions: 10,
  redisUrl: "redis://127.0.0.1",
  streamSwitchManager: MyStreamSwitchManager,
};

const engine = new ChannelEngine(refAssetManager, engineOptions);
engine.start();
engine.listen(process.env.port || 8000);
```
A StreamSwitcher component in the channel engine will continiously, in a set time interval, use the StreamSwitchManager to get the list and will inspect whether it should break into/out of the event, depending on the current time. 

Note that this feature is also currently in beta which means that it is close to production-ready but has not been run in production yet. We appreciate all efforts to try this out and provide feedback.
